# React

Here's where I learn react and share the results.

I used a book "Learning React". Check out [his repo](https://github.com/MoonHighway/learning-react/).

## functional

WIP. I was so impressed about how the author uses JavaScript in "functional way".

## basics

Basic stuff - ES6+, React DOM, Element, JSX, babel, webpack, etc.

## color-organizer

More advanced stuff - State, Component Tree, etc.
