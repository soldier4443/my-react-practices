# React

Here's where I learn react and share the results.

I used a book "Learning React". Check out [his repo](https://github.com/MoonHighway/learning-react/).

## functional

WIP. I was so impressed about how the author uses JavaScript in "functional way".

## basics

Basic stuff - ES6+, React DOM, Element, JSX, babel, webpack, etc.

## color-organizer

More advanced stuff - State, Component Tree, Redux, etc.

## todo-app

My ambitious project!! Shows how to use React and other libraries such as `axios`, `radium`, `recompose`.

## routertest

Just a quick tour of what is router and how to use it.
